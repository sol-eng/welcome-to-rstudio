# Welcome to RStudio

The RStudio IDE (Interactive Development Environment) is the perfect place to
write your R code. Use this example project as a tool for exploring the
capabilities of R and RStudio.

## How to Use

When links are presented within the document, CTRL + Click (or Cmd + Click) on
the path to navigate to that file. For example, a [Shiny
Application](./shiny-app/app.R).

## Types of Content

Most R users are familiar with "R scripts:" documents containing only
R code. While these are useful, there other useful types of content.

### Shiny Applications

Shiny applications are a popular way to build interactive web applications.
There is an [example Shiny application](./shiny-app/app.R) in this folder
for you to try! Navigate to the file and click "Run App" in the top right
corner.

### R Markdown Documents

This README is a R Markdown document. It is much like a markdown document,
except code is welcome! There is a 
[more typical RMarkdown document](./rmarkdown/analysis.Rmd) in this folder for
you to explore, as well.
